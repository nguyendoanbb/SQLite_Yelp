Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 	10000
ii. Business table = 	10000
iii. Category table = 	10000
iv. Checkin table = 		10000
v. elite_years table = 	10000
vi. friend table = 		10000
vii. hours table = 		10000
viii. photo table = 		10000
ix. review table = 		10000
x. tip table = 		10000
xi. user table = 		10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 	10000, primary key = id
ii. Hours = 		1562, foreign key = business_id
iii. Category = 	2643, foreign key = business_id
iv. Attribute = 	1115, foreign key = business_id
v. Review = 		8090, foreign key = business_id
vi. Checkin = 	493, foreign key = business_id
vii. Photo = 		6493, foreign key = business_id
viii. Tip = 		3973, foreign key = business_id
ix. User = 		10000, primary key = id
x. Friend = 		11, foreign key = user_id
xi. Elite_years = 	2780, foreign key = user_id

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, all 10 are listed as useful or funny. That is 100%, which indicates a strong relationship.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Yes, there is different distribution of hours
	2-3 stars group includes:
		-McDonald's: 19 hours of operation
		-Starbucks: 17 hours of operation
	4-5 stars group includes:
		-Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse: 11 hours of operation
		-Charlie D's Catfish & Chicken: 7 hours of operation

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	Yes and no. Bootleggers has much higher number of reviews, 431, compared to businesses in 2-3 stars group. But Charlie D's has only 7 reviews compared to 8 and 52 of McDonalds and Starbucks respectively. 
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	There is no correlation between location data and 2 groups. 

	SQL code used for analysis:
	SELECT b.name, 
		c.category, 
		b.stars,
		b.review_count,
		h.hours, 
		SUBSTR(h.hours,1,3) as open_day,
		b.postal_code as zipcode,
		b.latitude,
		b.longitude
	FROM business as b
		INNER JOIN category as c on b.id = c.business_id
		INNER JOIN hours as h on b.id = h.business_id
	WHERE b.city = 'Phoenix'
		AND c.category LIKE '%food%'
	GROUP BY b.stars, open_day
		HAVING b.stars in (2,2.5,3,4,4.5,5)
	ORDER BY b.stars, open_day
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
	Average number of reviews:
		Open: 31.76
		Closed: 23.20
         
ii. Difference 2:
	Average number of stars:
		Open: 3.68
		Closed: 3.52
         
SQL code used for analysis:
	SELECT is_open,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) as unique_id,
		AVG(review_count) as avg_review,
		SUM(review_count) as total_review,
		AVG(stars) as avg_stars
	FROM business as b
	GROUP BY b.is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	Predict ratings of user based on users' behaviors such as average_stars, compliment, elite_years, useful, funny, cool etc. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

	Yelp is a useful website where consumers can acquire information about stores or restaurants before their visit. Contribution from users plays a vital part in the success of Yelp. In addition, users also have a significant role in the success of businesses. A paper from Harvard Business School found that a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9% increase in revenue(*). Hence, users' rating is an important factor that businesses want to worry about. The purpose of this analysis is to predict users' rating based on their past behaviors such as polarity of sentiment in text, total number of given reviews, and rating stars. 
	Although text analysis and machine learning algorithm cannot be achieved simply with SQL, creating a complete dataset in SQL is a successful first step. The analysis may need further assistance from better statistical language in machine learning such as Python or R.

This is a pricey cafe to eat at. I had a simple appetizer of nachos and chicken which was an extra $4 added to the $12 order of nachos. The chips literally tasted like tostito chips. The chicken was non existent. I had to find the chicken bits hiding in parts of the chips and there wasn't much to begin with. I ate maybe 20% of my nachos and gave up. Kinda hard screw up nachos but somehow they did it. The jalapeños were also stale and old. After adding the coke I drank to the meal my nachos were literally $22. For an appetizer! I have had better nachos in hole in the wall bars for $7 and they tasted way better. |

You don't know which way to turn or frankly to order. It makes you wish you had an endless amount of money (in which some do) to order one of everything and do a tasting.  |

It's a dark chocolate shell with chocolate moose, caramel, and nuts inside. Phenomenal. A perfect blend of all four flavors. Now that I am thinking about this decant dessert, it makes me wonder if they ship. Ummmm???? |
